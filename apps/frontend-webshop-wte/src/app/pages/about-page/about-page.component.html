                accessible worldwide.</p>
            <p>Inspired by their backgrounds in nutrition and farming, Rick and Frank saw the need for a food system 
                that puts health first. They worked tirelessly to create a seamless farm-to-table experience, where 
                customers can enjoy fresh, organic produce with ease.</p>
