            <p>
                At <strong>What to Eat</strong>, we are dedicated to transforming how people think about food. We
                believe everyone should have access to clean, organic, and responsibly sourced produce that supports
                both personal well-being and environmental sustainability. Our approach is simple—connect farmers and
                local suppliers directly with customers, ensuring freshness and reducing unnecessary waste.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our platform was built for people who want to make healthier food choices without sacrificing
                convenience. Whether you’re stocking up for the week or planning meals for your family, you’ll find an
                assortment of fruits, vegetables, and pantry essentials that align with your lifestyle.
